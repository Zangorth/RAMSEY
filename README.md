# Ramsey
## Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop some modeling around the Dave Ramsey youtube channel. I hope to do some sentiment analysis and build models to determine what makes him angry/happy/sad etc. and also do some more "useful" modeling around the kinds of videos that are the most popular (using factors such as sentiment, topic of the conversation, etc.). 

Once we have some of that preliminary, and more basic, modeling done, I also think it would be interesting to build a chat bot that allows you to ask Dave questions. He has easily hundreds of hours of content published, and the message is mostly consistent, so I think developing a "What Would Dave Do" bot would be feasible, even if it could require a fair bit of effort. 

## Data Collection
The first step in the project is to collect the data we are going to be using for analysis. In order to do this I [scraped data](https://github.com/Zangorth/RAMSEY/blob/main/Data%20Scrape.py) from the [The Ramsey Show - Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheRamseyShow) YouTube channel. There are multiple Ramsey show channels, however, I am primarily interested in the call-in segments of the show, which this channel primarily distributes, and the "highlight" format of the channel allows you capture a single call without any extra effort. Similar content could have been scraped from the Ramsey Show Full Episodes channel, however, calls run back to back over a 2-3 hour period, so extra effort would have to be made to pull out and identify individual calls. The downside to this is that not every call is published to the highlights channel, but the benefit of not having to build an additional model identify calls seems worth it. Although, this may be revisited in the future. 

Some results of the data scraping process can be visualized below. The first graph shows the seven day running average of minutes of content published by day. So, if they published a 5 minute video, a 6 minute video, and a 7 minute video during the last seven day period the chart would show a seven day running average of 6 minutes of content published for that day. This was done to reduce the pretty drastic fluctuations in daily content published and helps to present a more clear picture of the trends. The first several years of the channels history have pretty wild fluctuations in amount of content published daily, declining to a low in 2017, and then steadily increasing year over year from that point. 

I also wanted to look at a Day of Week breakdown of this chart, as it wouldn't be uncommon for them to publish less on the weekends since they don't air any live shows on that day. This turned out as expected, with Saturday and Sunday seeing significantly less published content than the business days.
