# Ramsey

The goal of this project is to develop some modeling around the Dave Ramsey youtube channel. I hope to do some sentiment analysis and build models to determine what makes him angry/happy/sad etc. and also do some more "useful" modeling around the kinds of videos that are the most popular (using factors such as sentiment, topic of the conversation, etc.). 

Once we have some of that preliminary, and more basic, modeling done, I also think it would be interesting to build a chat bot that allows you to ask Dave questions. He has easily hundreds of hours of content published, and the message is mostly consistent, so I think developing a "What Would Dave Do" bot would be feasible, even if it could require a fair bit of effort.
